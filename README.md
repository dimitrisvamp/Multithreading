# Multithreading_at_Kiwi_OS

## University Project
A project from Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of Ioannina (UOI).

## Description
Multithreading implementation at Kiwi OS sources of the put and get operations for key-value pairs. <br />

The modifications are a mix of code extention at most of the files, including the use of mutex locks.

## Uploaded Files
***kiwi-source*** folder is a modified version of the original folder of Kiwi OS scourses as it contains <br /> 
both modified and unmodified files in order to achieve multithreading. <br /> 

Some modified files contains code extention by adding new functions or editing the already existed functions. <br /> 
The rest of modified files contain mutex locks placement.
